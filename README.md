# AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate Feb 2018 Exam's notes

In order to prepare the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate Feb 2018 Exam**, I made a document with a summary with all the relevant information to study for the exam. I took this information from the following sites:

* [Jayendra’s blog](http://jayendrapatil.com/) - An awesome blog to study and prepare the different AWS Certifications 
* [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/?nc1=h_ls) - AWS documentation 

I Also, added some extra needed knowledge for the exam and a key notes paragraph with the main information to know for each relevant service. 

I think this document can be useful for students who wants to prepare the AWS Solutions Architect certification so it is why I am uploading it to my GitHub account.
